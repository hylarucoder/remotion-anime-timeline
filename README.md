# Remotion Anime Timeline

A demo of integrating `anime.js` v3 with Remotion for smoother animations.

## Overview

While Remotion's built-in `animateUtils` provides animation capabilities, it can be verbose and challenging to maintain. This project demonstrates using `anime.js` as an alternative solution.

A custom timeline wrapper API has been implemented to simplify animation logic, though please note that hot reload functionality is currently affected when using this wrapper.
