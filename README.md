# Remotion Anime Timeline

A demo of integrating `anime.js` v3 with Remotion for smoother animations.

## Overview
While Remotion's built-in `animateUtils` provides animation capabilities, it can be verbose, unintuitive, and challenging to maintain. You often need to calculate values manually and pass props throughout your components.

This project demonstrates using `anime.js` as an alternative solution, offering a more streamlined approach to animations in Remotion.
